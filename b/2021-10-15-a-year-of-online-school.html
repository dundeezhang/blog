                October 15, 2021 - A Year of Online School
            </p>
            <p>
                Online school, or online learning is all about self regulation, and self independence. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Personally for me, I suck at self regulation, so it was a pain doing it. For example, during second semester, I had instrumental music as one of my courses. Honestly, since I play piano, there wasn't really much to learn in that class... Subsequently, much of my time was spent playing a certain game called [osu!], rather than spending time doing my classwork. However, as weird as it may seem, there wasn't really a penalty for my lack of effort.

                I don't know if it is all high school courses or what, but my courses this semester were all super easy. I even had science this semester. I just found the curriculum really underwhemling and I found myself feeling really dissapointed when the teachers finished their lessons. It's likely not the teachers faults, but barely anything was even taught. Even with my lack of attention in my classes, I would do well on the tests and assignments due to the lack of content in the courses. Although it is obvious in hindsight I would've done better if I was doing the classwork...
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking forwards, I hope the pandemic (COVID-19) will be gone soon and regular school can recommence. The quality of online courses just feels lackluster and leaves much more to be desired.
